Goal: Define and evolve the Selfware protocol and its agent-ready workspace conventions.

Primary Objective:
- Keep protocol docs (`selfware.md` and `selfware-zh.md`) accurate and reviewable.
- Make the workspace executable by both humans and agents via entrypoint definitions and file governance.

Current Sprint Goal:
- Establish the first collaboration protocol structure.
- Validate one end-to-end run with entrypoint/scripts/new-task.ps1 and entrypoint/scripts/new-run.ps1.

Constraints:
- No silent apply for protocol-level changes.
- Sensitive files (for example, .env) are human-only.
- Any change to governance/*, entrypoint/*, or selfware*.md requires human discussion.
